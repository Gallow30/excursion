# excursion project
The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, 
so I used video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page was created for marketing the product, 
and the goal is to entice potential customers into using the product.
I made use Git to create a local repository and connected it to the remote repository on Github
